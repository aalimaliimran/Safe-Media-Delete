# Safe Media Delete

Safe Media Delete is a WordPress plugin that enhances the WP Admin interface by providing additional features related to image management and deletion within the WordPress Media Library. This plugin helps prevent accidental deletion of images that are being used in various contexts across the website, such as featured images, post content, and term pages.

## Features

1. Image Upload and Selection in Term Pages
   - Adds a field on the Term Add and Term Edit pages to allow users to upload or select an existing PNG or JPEG image from the WordPress Media Library.
   - Provides an image preview functionality on the same screen using third-party libraries like CMB2.

2. Image Deletion Restrictions
   - Prevents the deletion of an image if it is set as a Featured Image in an article.
   - Prevents the deletion of an image if it is being used in the content of a post (Post Body).
   - Prevents the deletion of an image if it is being used in a Term Edit page (as implemented in point 1).
   - Displays a message to the user when attempting to delete an image that is being used elsewhere, asking them to remove the image from the associated posts or terms.
   - The interface displays the IDs of the affected post(s) or term(s) along with edit links for easy access.

3. Media Library Enhancements
   - Adds an "Attached Objects" column to the Media Library table, displaying a comma-separated list of IDs linked to the corresponding edit page.
   - Users can determine whether the ID corresponds to a post or a term, aiding in the identification of image usage.

4. REST API Functionality
   - Provides REST API endpoints under the `/assignment/v1/` namespace.
   - **Endpoint 1**: Returns details of a given image ID.
     - Response is a JSON object containing information such as ID, Date, Slug, Type (JPEG or PNG), Link, Alt text, and Attached Objects.
     - Attached Objects field contains Post or Term IDs to which the given image is attached, structured accordingly.
   - **Endpoint 2**: Deletes a given image if it is not attached to any posts or terms.
     - If the image is attached to any posts or terms, the response indicates that deletion has failed.
